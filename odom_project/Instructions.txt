ONE METHOD TO CALCULATE THE HIDDEN GEAR RATIO (manufacturer's manual is wrong, it's not 1:30):


        rpm_r = (fr->rpm + rr->rpm)/(2); // averaging the rpm  right and left values to reduce noise
		rpm_l = (fl->rpm + rl->rpm)/(2);
		vr = (rpm_r * (2 * 3.1416) * 1.575)/600; //right wheel linear velocity
		vl = -(rpm_l * (2 * 3.1416) * 1.575)/600; // left wheel linear velocity
		
		wrong_v_linear = (vr + vl) /2
		
		gear_ratio = wrong_v_linear / scout_odometry_linear_velocity

The best thing would be to find the average value, cleaning data from ouliers caused by noise. But we already know that the value is between 1:35 and 1:40
We found empirically that considering a gear ratio of 38.5 allows to obtain an odometry really precise wrt the manufacturer's one.


Finally, to find the baseline we just applied the simple equation (taken from classic differential kinematics): app_baseline = (vr-vl)/w
