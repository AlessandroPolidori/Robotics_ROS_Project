# Robotics_ROS_Project
2020/2021 Robotics course project <br />
first part: computing an odometry giving the opportunity to choose between Euler and Runge-Kutta integration methods <br />
 <br />

second part: given a bag file, creating a map using gmapping(slam) and then localizing the robot using an extended kalman filter to fuse imu data and manufacturer's odometry and a particle filter (using lidar data and filtered odometry) <br />
