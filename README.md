2020/2021 Robotics course project <br />
first part: computing an odometry giving the opportunity to choose between Euler and Runge-Kutta integration methods <br />
 <br />

second part: given a bag file, creating a map using gmapping(slam), fusing imu data and manufacturer's odometry with an ekf (extended-kalman-filter), then localizing the robot using a particle filter (montecarlo local. approach exploiting lidar data and ekf's filtered odometry) <br />
